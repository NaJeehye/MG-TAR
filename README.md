# MG-TAR
**Multi-view Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Accident Risk Prediction**

This is the implementation of the paper _submitted_ in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems

## Abstract
**TBD**

## Note for Driving Record Data
- **Digital Tachograph (Driving Log) Data**: _cannot be publicly accessible_ 
  - For demonstration purpose, we partially provide the aggregated number of _classified_ dangerous driving cases in the `datasets` folder. 
  - If you are interested in the original data, there is a sample file provided [here](https://www.data.go.kr/en/data/15050068/fileData.do) by Korea Transportation Safety Authority.

## Example Run
For package installation: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

For model testing: `Example Run.ipynb`

## Citation
